### Key Discoveries:

### Strategic Moves:

- **Sales Superheroes:** Focus on supercharging California and New York, our top sales performers.

- **Trimming Down:** Streamline operations in states like Texas, Florida, and Ohio to optimize outcomes.

- **Discount Dilemma:** Implement a makeover in the central region by adjusting discount rates for a profit boost.
